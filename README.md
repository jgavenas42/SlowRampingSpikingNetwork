# SlowRampingSpikingNetwork
Code Repository for simulation and analysis of networks that exhibit slow-ramping activity.

snap_fluxsim.m runs the main simulations using the connMatrix.m function (for construction of connectivity matrix) and snap_singletrial.m function (for simulation of a single trial of spiking data.

More information to be added.
